Collaboration Policy
--------------------

Homework assignments are essential for learning the course material, and a serious individual effort should be made to solve each problem. Students are encouraged to form interdisciplinary teams to discuss with other class members the underlying concepts and approaches. However, such discussions must stop short of jointly prepared solutions. That is, the work turned in must reflect one’s individual efforts.
